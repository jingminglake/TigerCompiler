# Tiger Compiler

This is Compiler Engineering Course Lab.

The link is http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/

The part I have finished:

1. Lexer and Parser.
Designed and implemented a front-end (a lexer and a parser) for Tiger.

2. Abstract Syntax Trees and Elaborator.
Designed and implemented an abstract syntax tree and build an elaborator.

3. Code Generator.
Designed and implemented a C code generator.

4. Garbage Collector.
Build a garbage collector and link it into Tiger.

The part I have not finished:

5. Optimizations.
Add optimizations to Tiger to enable it generator more efficient target code.

6: Register allocator.
Write a register allocator for Tiger so that Tiger compiler will generate efficient production-quality native code.
