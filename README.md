# Tiger Compiler

This is Compiler Engineering Course Lab.

The link is http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/

The part I have finished:

Part 1. Lexer and Parser.
</br>Designed and implemented a front-end (a lexer and a parser) for Tiger.

Part 2. Abstract Syntax Trees and Elaborator.
</br>Designed and implemented an abstract syntax tree and build an elaborator.

Part 3. Code Generator.
</br>Designed and implemented a C code generator.

Part 4. Garbage Collector.
</br>Build a garbage collector and link it into Tiger.

The part I have not finished:

Part 5. Optimizations.
</br>Add optimizations to Tiger to enable it generator more efficient target code.

Part 6. Register allocator.
</br>Write a register allocator for Tiger so that Tiger compiler will generate efficient production-quality native code.
