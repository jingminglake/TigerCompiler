# Tiger Compiler

This is Compiler Engineering Course Lab.

The link is http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/

The part I have finished:

Lab 1: lexer and parser.

Design and implement a front-end (a lexer and a parser) for Tiger.

Lab 2: abstract syntax trees and elaborator.

Design and implement an abstract syntax tree and build an elaborator.

Lab 3: code generator.

Design and implement several code generators: a C code generator

Lab 4: garbage collector.

Build a garbage collector and link it into Tiger.

The part I have not finished:

Lab 5: Optimizations.

Add optimizations to Tiger to enable it generator more efficient target code.

Lab 6: Register allocator.

Write a register allocator for Tiger so that  Tiger compiler will generate efficient production-quality native code.
