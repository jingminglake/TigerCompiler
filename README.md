http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/

The part I have finished:

Lab 1: lexer and parser.
Design and implement a front-end (a lexer and a parser) for Tiger.
Lab 2: abstract syntax trees and elaborator.
Design and implement an abstract syntax tree and build an elaborator.
Lab 3: code generator.
Design and implement several code generators: a C code generator
Lab 4: garbage collector. 
Build a garbage collector and link it into Tiger.

The part I have not finished:
Lab 5: Optimizations.
Add optimizations to Tiger to enable it generator more efficient target code.
Lab 6: Register allocator.
Write a register allocator for Tiger so that  Tiger compiler will generate efficient production-quality native code.
